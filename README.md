# FootStats - Live Football Score Application

## ‚öΩ Overview

FootStats is a dynamic, real-time web application designed to provide live updates for football matches. It features a clean, responsive user interface for fans to follow live scores and a comprehensive admin panel for managing all aspects of the matches, from creation to live event tracking.

The application is built with a Node.js backend that uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) to push live data to a React-based frontend, ensuring instant updates without the need for constant polling.
